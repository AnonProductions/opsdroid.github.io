# opsdroid.github.io
The website for opsdroid

This is a simple Jekyll website which acts as the central landing page for the [opsdroid](https://opsdroid.github.io) project.

The basic idea of the page is to provide a single place where users can easily navigate to anywhere in the opsdroid ecosystem.
To keep maintenance to a minimum this page should leverage third parts APIs to gather content dynamically. For example pulling
module lists from the GitHub API, or blog posts from Medium.
